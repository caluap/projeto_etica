	abstract = {In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, each point of an n-dimensional manifold has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension n.
One-dimensional manifolds include lines and circles, but not figure eights (because they have crossing points which are not locally homeomorphic to Euclidean 1-space). Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, which can all be embedded (formed without self-intersections) in three dimensional real space, but also the Klein bottle and real projective plane which will always self-intersect when immersed in real space.
Although a manifold locally resembles Euclidean space, globally it may not. For example, the surface of the sphere is not a Euclidean space, but in a region it can be charted by means of map projections of the region into the Euclidean plane (in the context of manifolds they are called charts). When a region appears in two neighbouring charts, the two representations do not coincide exactly and a transformation is needed to pass from one to the other, called a transition map.
The concept of a manifold is central to many parts of geometry and modern mathematical physics because it allows more complicated structures to be described and understood in terms of the relatively well-understood properties of Euclidean space. Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of systems of equations and as graphs of functions. Manifolds may have additional features. One important class of manifolds is the class of differentiable manifolds. This differentiable structure allows calculus to be done on manifolds. A Riemannian metric on a manifold allows distances and angles to be measured. Symplectic manifolds serve as the phase spaces in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, while four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds model spacetime in general relativity.},

	abstract = {In statistics, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC), or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, or recall in machine learning. The false-positive rate is also known as the fall-out and can be calculated as (1 - specificity). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity as a function of fall-out. In general, if the probability distributions for both detection and false alarm are known, the ROC curve can be generated by plotting the cumulative distribution function (area under the probability distribution from

    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle -{\textbackslash}infty \}
   to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the cumulative distribution function of the false-alarm probability in x-axis.
ROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making.
The ROC curve was first developed by electrical engineers and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battlefields and was soon introduced to psychology to account for perceptual detection of stimuli. ROC analysis since then has been used in medicine, radiology, biometrics, and other areas for many decades and is increasingly used in machine learning and data mining research.
The ROC is also known as a relative operating characteristic curve, because it is a comparison of two operating characteristics (TPR and FPR) as the criterion changes.},

	abstract = {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

	abstract = {Many successful models for scene or object recognition transform low-level descriptors (such as Gabor filter responses, or SIFT descriptors) into richer representations of intermediate complexity. This process can often be broken down into two steps: (1) a coding step, which performs a pointwise transformation of the descriptors into a representation better adapted to the task, and (2) a pooling step, which summarizes the coded features over larger neighborhoods. Several combinations of coding and pooling schemes have been proposed in the literature. The goal of this paper is threefold. We seek to establish the relative importance of each step of mid-level feature extraction through a comprehensive cross evaluation of several types of coding modules (hard and soft vector quantization, sparse coding) and pooling schemes (by taking the average, or the maximum), which obtains state-of-the-art performance or better on several recognition benchmarks. We show how to improve the best performing coding scheme by learning a supervised discriminative dictionary for sparse coding. We provide theoretical and empirical insight into the remarkable performance of max pooling. By teasing apart components shared by modern mid-level feature extractors, our approach aims to facilitate the design of better recognition architectures.},

The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films.},

However, the former generally includes many redundant streamlines, and the latter requires Boolean decisions on which points are features (and may thus suffer from robustness problems for real-world data). We take a new approach to adaptive streamline placement for steady vector fields in 2D and 3D. We define a metric for local similarity among streamlines and use this metric to grow streamlines from a dense set of candidate seed points. The metric considers not only Euclidean distance, but also a simple statistical measure of shape and directional similarity. Without explicit feature detection, our method produces streamlines that naturally accentuate regions of geometric interest. In conjunction with this method, we also propose a quantitative error metric for evaluating a streamline representation based on how well it preserves the information from the original vector field. This error metric reconstructs a vector field from points on the streamline representation and computes a difference of the reconstruction from the original vector field.},

This technique enables vector field design and editing on the plane and surfaces with desired qualitative properties. The technique is based on Conley theory which provides a unified framework that supports the cancellation of fixed points and periodic orbits. We also introduce a novel periodic orbit extraction and visualization algorithm that detects, for the first time, periodic orbits on surfaces. Furthermore, we describe the application of our periodic orbit detection and vector field simplification algorithm to engine simulation data demonstrating the utility of the approach. We apply our design system to vector field visualization by creating datasets containing periodic orbits. This helps us understand the effectiveness of existing visualization techniques.

In each region, a seeding path is selected from a set of streamlines integrated in the orthogonal flow field. The uniform sample points on this path are then used as seeds to generate streamlines in the original flow field. Additional seeds are placed where a large gap between adjacent streamlines occurs. The number of short streamlines is significantly reduced as evenly spaced long streamlines spawned along the seeding paths can fill the topological regions very well. Several metrics for evaluating streamline placement quality are discussed and applied to our method as well as some other approaches. Compared to previous work in uniform streamline placement, our method is more effective in creating evenly spaced long streamlines and preserving topological features. It has the potential to provide both intuitive perception of important flow characteristics and detail reconstruction across visually pleasing streamlines.},

	abstract = {Tensor fields are at the heart of many science and engineering disciplines. Many tensor visualization methods separate the tensor into component eigenvectors and visualize those instead. Eigenvectors are normally ordered according to their eigenvalues: the eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest, median, or largest eigenvalues are in their corresponding groups. We show that this ordering strategy is undesirable for liquid crystal systems and propose a new approach, where the vectors are grouped to minimize some local energy. The grouping process is reminiscent of the epitaxial expansion in the anchoring of liquid crystals on a surface. The new algorithm is successfully applied to a liquid crystal system to study the biaxiality structure near a defect.},

The simulation data consists of terabytes of data describing the position and orientation of every molecule in the simulated system over time. Condensed matter physicists study the evolution of topological defects in these data, and our visualization tools focus on that goal. We first convert the discrete simulation data to a sampled version of a continuous second-order tensor field and then use combinations of visualization methods to simultaneously display combinations of contractions of the tensor data, providing an interactive environment for exploring these complicated data. The system, built using AVS, employs colored cutting planes, colored isosurfaces, and colored integral curves to display fields of tensor contractions including Westin's scalar cl, cp , and cs metrics and the principal eigenvector. Our approach has been in active use in the physics lab for over a year. It correctly displays structures already known; it displays the data in a spatially and temporally smoother way than earlier approaches, avoiding confusing grid effects and facilitating the study of multiple time steps; it extends the use of tools developed for visualizing diffusion tensor data, re-interpreting them in the context of molecular simulations; and it has answered long-standing questions regarding the orientation of molecules around defects and the conformational changes of the defects},

We show how these techniques can be used to first locate topological defects in fluid simulations of nematic liquid crystals where the locations are not known a priori and then study the properties of these defects including the core structure. We apply these techniques to simulation data obtained by previous authors who studied a rapid quench and subsequent equilibration of a Gay-Berne nematic. The quench produces a large number of disclination loops which we locate and track with the visualization methods. We show that the cores of the disclination lines have a biaxial region and the loops themselves are of a hybrid wedge-twist variety.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an adaptive seeding strategy for visualization of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) data using streamtubes. DT-MRI is a medical imaging modality that captures unique water diffusion properties and fiber orientation information of the imaged tissues. Visualizing DT-MRI data using streamtubes has the advantage that not only the anisotropic nature of the diffusion is visualized but also the underlying anatomy of biological structures is revealed. This makes streamtubes significant for the analysis of fibrous tissues in medical images. In order to avoid rendering multiple similar streamtubes, an adaptive seeding strategy is employed which takes into account similarity of tensors in a given region. The goal is to automate the process of generating seed points such that regions with dissimilar tensors are assigned more seed points compared to regions with similar tensors. The algorithm is based on tensor dissimilarity metrics that take into account both diffusion magnitudes and directions to optimize the seeding positions and density of streamtubes in order to reduce the visual clutter. Two recent advances in tensor calculus and tensor dissimilarity metrics are utilized: the Log-Euclidean and the J-divergence. Results show that adaptive seeding not only helps to cull unnecessary streamtubes that would obscure visualization but also do so without having to compute the culled streamtubes, which makes the visualization process faster.},

We describe the structures in the eigenvalue and eigenvector fields of the gradient tensor and how these structures can be used to infer the behaviors of the velocity field. To illustrate the structures in asymmetric tensor fields, we introduce the notions of eigenvalue and eigenvector manifolds. These concepts afford a number of theoretical results that clarify the connections between symmetric and antisymmetric components in tensor fields. In addition, these manifolds naturally lead to partitions of tensor fields, which we use to design effective visualization strategies. Both eigenvalue manifold and eigenvector manifold are supported by a tensor reparameterization with physical meaning. This allows us to relate our tensor analysis to physical quantities such as rotation, angular deformation, and dilation, which provide physical interpretation of our tensor-driven vector field analysis in the context of fluid mechanics. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we have applied our visualization techniques and interpretation to the study of the Sullivan vortex as well as computational fluid dynamics simulation data.},

These datasets often consist of a large number of sample locations and several time steps. The steadily increasing performance of computers has recently become a driving factor for a reemergence in flow visualization research, especially in texture-based techniques. In this paper, dense, texture-based flow visualization techniques are discussed. This class of techniques attempts to provide a complete, dense representation of the flow field with high spatio-temporal coherency. An attempt of categorizing closely related solutions is incorporated and presented. Fundamentals are shortly addressed as well as advantages and disadvantages of the methods.},

	abstract = {Purpose

Since Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) data acquisition and processing are not standardized, substantial differences in DWI derived measures such as Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) may arise which are related to the acquisition or MRI processing method, but not to the sample under study. Quality assurance using a standardized test object, or phantom, is a key factor in standardizing DWI across scanners.


Methods

Current diffusion phantoms are either complex to use, not available in larger quantities, contain substances unwanted in a clinical environment, or are expensive. A diffusion phantom based on a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution, together with a phantom holder, is presented and compared to existing diffusion phantoms for use in clinical DWI scans. An ADC vs temperature calibration curve was obtained.


Results

ADC of the phantom (808 to 857±0.2 mm2/s) is in the same range as ADC values found in brain tissue. ADC measurements are highly reproducible across time with an intra-class correlation coefficient of {\textgreater} 0.8. ADC as function of temperature (in Kelvin) can be estimated asADCm(T) = [exp(−7.09) exp(−2903.8(1/T-1/293.55))] with a total uncertainty (95\% confidence limit) of ±1.7\%


Conclusion

We present an isotropic diffusion MRI phantom, together with its temperature calibration curve, that is easy to use in a clinical environment, cost-effective, reproducible to produce and that contains no harmful substances.

In this MR study, we imaged with high-angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) abnormal cerebellar cortical structure (gray matter) and myelinated axonal pathways (white matter) of a mouse spontaneous mutation, Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd), in which almost all Purkinje neurons degenerate, mainly between postnatal days 20 and 35. Mouse brains at postnatal day 20 (P20) and at 8 months were scanned, and known or expected abnormalities, such as reduction of the white matter volume, disorganized pathways likely linked to parallel fibers, mossy fibers, and other fibers running from/to the cerebellar cortex were observed in mutant mice. Such abnormalities were detected at both an early and a fully advanced degeneration stage. These results suggest that our diffusion MR tractography is useful for early detection and tracking of neuropathology in the cerebellum.},

	abstract = {Introduction
White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) presumed to reflect cerebral small vessel disease and increased peripheral inflammatory markers are found commonly in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their interrelationships remain unclear.
Methods
Inflammatory markers were assayed in 54 elderly participants with AD (n = 16). Periventricular WMHs were delineated from T1, T2/proton density, and fluid-attenuated magnetic resonance imaging using semiautomated fuzzy lesion extraction and coregistered with maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of microstructural integrity assessed using diffusion tensor imaging.
Results
Mean FA within periventricular WMHs was associated with an inflammatory factor consisting of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor, IL-10, IL-21, and IL-23 in patients with AD (ρ = −0.703, P = .002) but not in healthy elderly (ρ = 0.217, P = .190). Inflammation was associated with greater FA in deep WMH in healthy elderly (ρ = 0.425, P = .008) but not in patients with AD (ρ = 0.174, P = .520).
Discussion
Peripheral inflammatory markers may be differentially related to microstructural characteristics within the white matter affected by cerebral small vessel disease in elders with and without AD.},

To better understand the abnormal functioning of these networks, research has begun to investigate the structural connections between brain regions implicated in AB using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which assesses white-matter tract microstructure. This systematic review integrates findings from 22 studies that examined the relationship between white-matter microstructure and AB across development. In contrast to a prior hypothesis that AB is associated with greater diffusivity specifically in the uncinate fasciculus, findings suggest that adult AB is associated with greater diffusivity across a range of white-matter tracts, including the uncinate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, cingulum, corticospinal tract, thalamic radiations, and corpus callosum. The pattern of findings among youth studies was inconclusive with both higher and lower diffusivity found across various association, commissural, and projection and thalamic tracts.},

	abstract = {In vivo cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive method to map the complex, three-dimensional fibre architecture of the beating heart. It allows the assessment and characterisation of the myocardium and has been employed successfully to image myocardial tissue alterations in a number of relevant diseases. Cardiac diffusion imaging has been primarily performed using stimulated echo based pulse sequences. With recent developments in magnetic resonance hardware and pulse sequence design, spin echo based approaches have become attractive alternatives. The following work presents a comprehensive comparison of stimulated echo and spin echo based cardiac diffusion imaging approaches. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and diffusion metrics in phantoms and in the in vivo human heart are analysed and a modification to previous diffusion encoding schemes is proposed. In vivo cardiac DTI is implemented and applied to study dynamic fibre reorientation between heart phases in a patient population with dilated cardiomyopathy. Diffusion tensor metrics are compared relative to a healthy control group and correlated to cardiac motion parameters. To address long acquisition times, dual-slice excitation and dedicated image reconstruction are proposed and implemented in a separate study of healthy volunteers. The impact of microvascular perfusion on the diffusion-weighted signal is investigated in a porcine model of myocardial infarction. The intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model is employed to obtain perfusion metrics which are correlated to dynamic contrast enhanced perfusion measurements. A validation of the IVIM model is performed by comparing in vivo IVIM parameters relative to post mortem reference measurements without motion and perfusion effects. Additionally, Bayesian inference is proposed to reduce variability of diffusion and perfusion parameter estimation.},

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) features of cervical spinal cord astrocytoma.
Methods
Eleven patients with cervical spinal cord astrocytomas and 10 healthy volunteers were recruited in this study. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and axial DTI were performed on a 3.0T MRI system. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) values for the lesions were measured. DTT was performed using the principal diffusion direction method.
Results
ADC values of the lesions and the normal-appearing tissue around the tumour (NATAT) on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) increased. The ADC values of the lesions were higher. The FA values of the lesions and the NATAT decreased significantly, with the lesions having lower FA values. The RD value (1.36 ± 0.49) of the tumours was significantly higher than those found in the healthy controls, but similar for the AD value (1.84 ± 0.56). There were no differences in ADC or FA values between lesions and NATAT in McCormick Type I vs. Type II patients. Based on the DTT, 7 patients with solid mass tumours were classified as Type I. One patient with a solid mass, 2 patients with cystic degeneration inside the lesions, and 1 patient with a cyst around the mass were classified as Type II.
Conclusions
FA values of the cervical spinal cord astrocytoma decreased, but the ADC values increased. DTI was sensitive for the evaluation of pathological changes that could not be visualized on T2WI. Our preliminary study indicates that DTT can be used to guide operation planning, and that axial images of DTT may be more valuable.},

Morphometry is quantified globally by the volumetric measurement and locally by the vertexwise surface areas. Meanwhile, microstructural integrity is quantified globally by the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and trace values within the specific WM tract and locally by the FA and trace values defined at each vertex of its bounding surface. The proposed pipeline consists of four steps: (1) fully automated segmentation of WM tracts in a multi-contrast multi-atlas framework; (2) generation of the smooth surface representations for the WM tracts of interest; (3) common template surface generation on which the localized morphometric and microstructural statistics are defined and a variety of statistical analyses can be conducted; (4) multiple comparison correction to determine the significance of the statistical analysis results. Detailed herein, this pipeline has been applied to the corpus callosum in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with significantly decreased FA values and increased trace values, both globally and locally, being detected in patients with AD when compared to normal aging populations. A subdivision of the corpus callosum in both hemispheres revealed that the AD pathology primarily affects the body and splenium of the corpus callosum.

We distinguish between linear anisotropy and planar anisotropy and represent values in the two regimes using streamtubes and streamsurfaces, respectively. Streamtubes represent structures with primarily linear diffusion, typically fiber tracts; streamtube direction correlates with tract orientation. The cross-sectional shape and color of each streamtube represent additional information from the diffusion tensor at each point. Streamsurfaces represent structures in which diffusion is primarily planar. Our algorithm chooses a very small representative subset of the streamtubes and streamsurfaces for display. We describe the set of metrics used for the culling process, which reduces visual clutter and improves interactivity. We also generate anatomical landmarks to identify the locations of such structures as the eyes, skull surface, and ventricles. The final models are complex surface geometries that can be imported into many interactive graphics software environments. We describe a virtual environment to interact with these models. Expert feedback from doctors studying changes in white-matter structures after gamma-knife capsulotomy and preoperative planning for brain tumor surgery shows that streamtubes correlate well with major neural structures, the 2D section and geometric landmarks are important in understanding the visualization, and the stereo and interactivity from the virtual environment aid in understanding the complex geometric models.},

	abstract = {Purpose:
To establish a general methodology for quantifying streamline-based diffusion fiber tracking methods in terms of probability of connection between points and/or regions.
Materials and Methods:
The commonly used streamline approach is adapted to exploit the uncertainty in the orientation of the principal direction of diffusion defined for each image voxel. Running the streamline process repeatedly using Monte Carlo methods to exploit this inherent uncertainty generates maps of connection probability. Uncertainty is defined by interpreting the shape of the diffusion orientation profile provided by the diffusion tensor in terms of the underlying microstructure.
Results:
Two candidates for describing the uncertainty in the diffusion tensor are proposed and maps of probability of connection to chosen start points or regions are generated in a number of major tracts.
Conclusion:
The methods presented provide a generic framework for utilizing streamline methods to generate probabilistic maps of connectivity. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2003;18:242–254. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Our method consists of placing one streamline at a time by numerical integration starting at the furthest away from all previously placed streamlines. Such a farthest point seeding strategy leads to high quality placements by favoring long streamlines, while retaining uniformity with the increasing density. Our greedy approach generates placements of comparable quality with respect to the optimization approach from Turk and Banks, while being 200 times faster. Simplicity, robustness as well as efficiency is achieved through the use of a Delaunay triangulation to model the streamlines, address proximity queries and determine the biggest voids by exploiting the empty circle property.

This fascicle map is defined as a trade-off between local information on voxel microstructure provided by diffusion data and a priori information on the low curvature of plausible fascicles. The optimal fascicle map is the minimum energy configuration of a simulated spin glass in which each spin represents a fascicle piece. This spin glass is embedded into a simulated magnetic external field that tends to align the spins along the more probable fiber orientations according to diffusion models. A model of spin interactions related to the curvature of the underlying fascicles introduces a low bending potential constraint. Hence, the optimal configuration is a trade-off between these two kind of forces acting on the spins. Experimental results are presented for the simplest spin glass model made up of compass needles located in the center of each voxel of a tensor based acquisition.

Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations forall the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming interface.We have implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as thediffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition,cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such asconstrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum imaging withdeconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic tracking and originalmethods for tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions areprovided to calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as wellas file-handling routines to assist in the development and use of noveltechniques.In contrast to many other scientific software projects, Dipy is not beingdeveloped by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project thatencourages contributions from any scientist/developer through GitHub and opendiscussions on the project mailing list.

	abstract = {Decoding the neural representations of pain is essential to obtaining an objective assessment as well as an understanding of its underlying mechanisms. The complexities involved in the subjective experience of pain make it difficult to obtain a quantitative assessment from the induced spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity of high dimensionality. Most previous studies have investigated the perception of pain by analyzing the amplitude or spatial patterns in the response of the brain to external stimulation. This study investigated the decoding of endogenous pain perceptions according to resting-state magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings. In our experiments, we applied a beamforming method to calculate the brain activity for every brain region and examined temporal and spectral features of brain activity for predicting the intensity of perceived pain in patients with primary dysmenorrhea undergoing menstrual pain. Our results show that the asymmetric index of sample entropy in the precuneus and the sample entropy in the left posterior cingulate gyrus were the most informative characteristics associated with the perception of menstrual pain. The correlation coefficient (ρ=0.64, p\&lt;0.001) between the predicted and self-reported pain scores demonstrated the high prediction accuracy. In addition to the estimated brain activity, we were able to predict accurate pain scores directly from MEG channel signals (ρ=0.65, p\&lt;0.001). These findings suggest the possibility of using the proposed model based on resting-state MEG to predict the perceived intensity of endogenous pain.},

	abstract = {The ability to non-invasively assess skeletal muscle microstructure, which predicts function and disease, would be of significant clinical value.  One method that holds this promise is diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI), which is sensitive to the microscopic diffusion of water within tissues and has become ubiquitous in neuroimaging as a way of assessing neuronal structure and damage.  However, its application to the assessment of changes in muscle microstructure associated with injury, pathology, or age remain poorly defined, because it is difficult to precisely control muscle microstructural features in vivo. However, recent advances in additive manufacturing technologies allow precision-engineered diffusion phantoms with histology informed skeletal muscle geometry to be manufactured. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop skeletal muscle phantoms at relevant size scales in order to relate microstructural features to MRI-based diffusion measurements. A digital light projection based rapid 3D printing method was used to fabricate polyethylene glycol diacrylate based diffusion phantoms with; 1) idealized muscle geometry (no geometry; fiber sizes of 30μm, 50μm or 70μm; or fiber size of 50μm with 40\% of walls randomly deleted) or 2) histology-based geometry (normal and after 30-days of denervation) containing 20\% or 50\% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mean absolute percent error (8\%) of the printed phantoms indicated high conformity to templates when “fibers” were greater than 50μm. A multiple spin-echo EPI diffusion sequence capable of acquiring diffusion weighted data at several echo times, was used in an attempt to combine relaxometry and diffusion techniques with the goal of separating intracellular and extracellular diffusion signals. When fiber size increased (30μm to 70μm) in the 20\% PBS phantom, fractional anisotropy (FA) decreased (0.32-0.26) and mean diffusivity increased (0.44x10-3 mm2/s-0.70x10-3 mm2/s). Similarly, when fiber size increased from 30 μm to 70 μm in the 50\% PBS diffusion phantoms, a small change in FA was observed (0.18-0.22), but mean diffusivity increased from 0.86x10-3 mm2/s-1.79x10-3 mm2/s). This study demonstrates a novel application of tissue engineering to understand complex diffusion signals in skeletal muscle. Through this work, we have also demonstrated the feasibility of 3D printing for skeletal muscle with relevant matrix geometries and physiologically relevant tissue characteristics.},

DTI can depict fiber trajectory but it has limited angular resolution and cannot adequately assess cortical regions. We visualized potential pathways of bitemporal epilepsy propagation using diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with data consisting of 8 groups of 514 directions and diffusion templates of 842 subjects from the human connectome project (HCP). We verified the results with reference to the axonal-tracing literature. Both the large population overall and individual connection properties were investigated. In both the HCP 842 atlas and DSI individual data, the bilateral temporal pole was found to connect via the anterior commissure. The splenium of the corpus callosum was divided into 3 subregions (CS1, CS2, CS3) according to the form of connections. CS1 was predominately located at the rostral third and the dorsal part of middle third of the splenium; it communicated with the bilateral parietal lobe. SC2 was predominately located at the ventral middle third of the splenium. Fibers passed through the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle and connected to regions lateral of the occipitotemporal sulci. CS3 was located at the caudal third of the splenium. Together with the hippocampal commissure, its fibers constituted the medial wall of the lateral ventricle and distributed medially to the occipitotemporal sulci. The trajectory of bilateral temporal connections was visualized in this study; the results might help in the understanding and treatment of inter-hemispherical propagation of temporal-lobe epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Recently, we published a first anatomical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) atlas regarding white matter tracts in the canine brain. The purpose of this study was to show the significance of DTI in the revelation of the white matter fibres in the feline brain (i.e., to obtain an anatomical DTI atlas of images) and to descriptively compare these to previously obtained white matter fibre images of the canine brain. DTI MR Images of four cats euthanized for reasons other than neurological disorders were obtained with a 3 T system. Combined fractional anisotropic (FA) and directional maps were obtained within the hour after death. An experienced anatomist tracked white matter tracts of clinical relevance using the scanner software. After validation of these tracts, we compared relevant neurological connections between the cat and the dog. Comparison of cerebral structures between different species is easier when the three dimensional anatomy is visualized by using DTI. 3D rendered DTI images clearly show major differences in neurological architecture between cats and dogs for example, the more important space occupying role of the limbic system, and the less diffuse, less nodular, less pronounced and thinner fibre bundles in the feline brain compared to the canine brain (except for the cerebellum different parts connecting fibres passing through the brainstem which are pronouncedly developed).

	abstract = {Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) quantifies water molecule diffusion within tissues and is becoming an increasingly used technique. However, it is very challenging as correct quantification depends on many different factors, ranging from acquisition parameters to a long pipeline of image processing. In this work, we investigated the influence of voxel geometry on diffusion analysis, comparing different acquisition orientations as well as isometric and anisometric voxels. Diffusion-weighted images of one rat brain were acquired with four different voxel geometries (one isometric and three anisometric in different directions) and three different encoding orientations (coronal, axial and sagittal). Diffusion tensor scalar measurements, tractography and the brain structural connectome were analyzed for each of the 12 acquisitions. The acquisition direction with respect to the main magnetic field orientation affected the diffusion results. When the acquisition slice-encoding direction was not aligned with the main magnetic field, there were more artifacts and a lower signal-to-noise ratio that led to less anisotropic tensors (lower fractional anisotropic values), producing poorer quality results. The use of anisometric voxels generated statistically significant differences in the values of diffusion metrics in specific regions. It also elicited differences in tract reconstruction and in different graph metric values describing the brain networks. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account the geometric aspects of acquisitions, especially when comparing diffusion data acquired using different geometries.},

Performing maintenance tasks in a complex environment is quite challenging and difficult due to complex, and possibly, underground facilities, uneasy access, human factors, heavy machineries, etc. Current technology is not acceptable because of significant delays in communication and data transmission, missing multi-input interfaces, and simultaneous supervision of multiple workers who are working in the extreme environment. The aim is to technically advance and combine several technologies and integrate them as integral part of a personnel safety system to improve safety, maintain availability, reduce errors and decrease the time needed for scheduled or ad hoc interventions. We emphasize on the aspects that were made “feasible” on the worker's side due to the equipment used (mobile computing equipment). We present that the demanding tasks that previously were simply undertaken on the fixed infrastructure are now possible on the mobile end. The research challenges lie in the development of real-time data-transmission, instantaneous analysis of data coming from different inputs, local intelligence in low power embedded systems, interaction with multiple on-site users, complex user interfaces, portability and wearability.

	abstract = {Although cadavers constitute the gold standard for teaching anatomy to medical and health science students, there are substantial financial, ethical, and supervisory constraints on their use. In addition, although anatomy remains one of the fundamental areas of medical education, universities have decreased the hours allocated to teaching gross anatomy in favor of applied clinical work. The release of virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices allows learning to occur through hands-on immersive experiences. The aim of this research was to assess whether learning structural anatomy utilizing VR or AR is as effective as tablet-based (TB) applications, and whether these modes allowed enhanced student learning, engagement and performance. Participants (n = 59) were randomly allocated to one of the three learning modes: VR, AR, or TB and completed a lesson on skull anatomy, after which they completed an anatomical knowledge assessment. Student perceptions of each learning mode and any adverse effects experienced were recorded. No significant differences were found between mean assessment scores in VR, AR, or TB. During the lessons however, VR participants were more likely to exhibit adverse effects such as headaches (25\% in VR P {\textless} 0.05), dizziness (40\% in VR, P {\textless} 0.001), or blurred vision (35\% in VR, P {\textless} 0.01). Both VR and AR are as valuable for teaching anatomy as tablet devices, but also promote intrinsic benefits such as increased learner immersion and engagement. These outcomes show great promise for the effective use of virtual and augmented reality as means to supplement lesson content in anatomical education.

	abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) simulations have become a major component of the US Military and commercial training. VR is an attractive training method because it is readily available at a lower cost than traditional training methods. This has led to a staggering increase in demand for VR technology and research. To meet this demand, game engines such as Unity3D and Unreal have made substantial efforts to support various forms of VR, including the HTC Vive, smartphone-enabled devices like the GearVR, and with appropriate plugins, even fully-immersive Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVETM) systems. Because of this hardware diversity, there is a need to develop VR applications that can operate on several systems, also known as cross-platform development. The goal in developing applications for all these types of systems is to create a consistent user experience across the devices. It is challenging to maintain this consistent user experience, because many VR devices have fundamental differences. Research has begun to explore ways of developing one application for multiple system. The Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC) developed a VR football “Game Day” simulation that was deployed to three devices: CAVETM, Oculus Rift HMD and a mobile HMD. Development of this application presented many learning opportunities regarding cross-platform development. There is no single approach to achieving consistency across VR systems, but the authors hope to disseminate these best practices in cross-platform VR development through the game day application example. This research will help the US Military develop applications to be deployed across many VR systems.},

	abstract = {Virtual and mixed reality technology has advanced tremendously over the past several years. This nascent medium has the potential to transform how people communicate over distance, train for unfamiliar tasks, operate in challenging environments, and how they visualize, interact, and make decisions based on complex data. At the same time, the marketplace has experienced a proliferation of network-connected devices and generalized sensors that are becoming increasingly accessible and ubiquitous. As the Internet of Things" expands to encompass a predicted 50 billion connected devices by 2020, the volume and complexity of information generated in pervasive and virtualized environments will continue to grow exponentially. The convergence of these trends demands a theoretically grounded research agenda that can address emerging challenges for human-information interaction (HII). Virtual and mixed reality environments can provide controlled settings where HII phenomena can be observed and measured, new theories developed, and novel algorithms and interaction techniques evaluated. In this paper, we describe the intersection of pervasive computing with virtual and mixed reality, identify current research gaps and opportunities to advance the fundamental understanding of HII, and discuss implications for the design and development of cyber-human systems for both military and civilian use.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this meta-analysis is to examine overall effect as well as the impact of selected instructional design principles in the context of virtual reality technology-based instruction (i.e. games, simulation, virtual worlds) in K-12 or higher education settings. A total of 13 studies (N = 3081) in the category of games, 29 studies (N = 2553) in the category of games, and 27 studies (N = 2798) in the category of virtual worlds were meta-analyzed. The key inclusion criteria were that the study came from K-12 or higher education settings, used experimental or quasi-experimental research designs, and used a learning outcome measure to evaluate the effects of the virtual reality-based instruction.
Results suggest games (FEM = 0.77; REM = 0.51), simulations (FEM = 0.38; REM = 0.41), and virtual worlds (FEM = 0.36; REM = 0.41) were effective in improving learning outcome gains. The homogeneity analysis of the effect sizes was statistically significant, indicating that the studies were different from each other. Therefore, we conducted moderator analysis using 13 variables used to code the studies. Key findings included that: games show higher learning gains than simulations and virtual worlds. For simulation studies, elaborate explanation type feedback is more suitable for declarative tasks whereas knowledge of correct response is more appropriate for procedural tasks. Students performance is enhanced when they conduct the game play individually than in a group. In addition, we found an inverse relationship between number of treatment sessions learning gains for games.
With regards to the virtual world, we found that if students were repeatedly measured it deteriorates their learning outcome gains. We discuss results to highlight the importance of considering instructional design principles when designing virtual reality-based instruction.},
